*“Even when the hearth is still and the longhouse quiet, *Runegard* keeps watch. A sentinel forged not in steel — but in code and purpose.”*

Runegard is no ordinary tool. It is a vigilant watcher, a silent raven perched upon your system, awaiting the call to alert, to inform, to serve. Forged in the fires of Nord-themed design and wielded through the might of Python, Runegard lives in your tray and rises when called.

It was born to serve the realm — *your* realm.

## ⚔️ Features of the Shieldmaiden


- **Elegant Tray Sentinel** — resides in silence until the call is sounded  
- **Toast Notifications** — alerts sent like ravens on the wind  
- **Settings Interface** — toggle the runes of control with native GUI might  
- **Nord-Themed Beauty** — a shadowed, serene visual strength  
- **Start on Login** — Runegard rises with your system like the sun over Midgard  
- **Portable** — no Python, no pip, no dependencies. Just the will to run.

## ⚙️ To Summon the Guardian

### 📥 Download

Venture to the [Releases](https://github.com/DrakkarWolf/runegard/releases) page and claim the latest `.exe`. No dragons block your path — only the quiet thrill of preparation.

### 🧭 First Time Setup

Run it once. Let it create its **rune-scroll** (`runegard_config.json`) beside the executable.  
Then shape it to your will from within the settings.

### 💬 Sending a Message via Netcat

When your sentinel keeps watch over the realm, call upon it across the winds of the network. Speak these 
runes, replacing the placeholders with the IP and port of the guardian’s domain:

```
echo "Your message here" | nc.exe <IP_ADDRESS> <PORT_NUMBER>
```
This invocation carries across the lands of Linux, Unix, and the Windows realms alike.<br>
Ensure `nc.exe` (Netcat) is available in your PATH, and the raven shall hear your call from the land of Windows as well.<br><br>

The raven listens. Speak clearly, and it shall carry your words.
